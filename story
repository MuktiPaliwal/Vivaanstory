Title : The Hare and the Tortoise


Once upon a time , in a jungle, there lived a hare and a tortoise. These two used to be friends, but fine day they got into a quarrel 
and the hare started mocking the tortoise. 

The tortoise got upset and challenged the hare for a race. 

Hare says, we will race from my home to the other side of the jungle.
